Description :- I used iris dataset in machine learning in which we have attributes such as sepal_length, sepl_width, petal_length, and petal_width of 150 iris flowers from three different species. 
In iris dataset we have 150 rows and 5 columns which are sepal_length, sepl_width, petal_length, petal_width, and species. The species are setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This dataset can used for various tasks such as classification, clustering, visualization, and data analysis. 
About app :- I used streamlit app to deploy the model.
